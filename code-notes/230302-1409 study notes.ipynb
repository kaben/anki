    "Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive\n",
    "applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal\n",
    "spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In\n",
    "this paper, we introduce generative agents—computational software\n",
    "agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents\n",
    "wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while\n",
    "authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\n",
    "conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan\n",
    "the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record\n",
    "of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those\n",
    "memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them\n",
    "dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents\n",
    "to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The\n",
    "Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five\n",
    "agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative\n",
    "agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion\n",
    "that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents\n",
    "autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two\n",
    "days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the\n",
    "party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right\n",
    "time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of\n",
    "our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each\n",
    "contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing\n",
    "large language models with computational, interactive agents, this\n",

    "In this paper, we introduce generative agents—agents that draw\n",
    "on generative models to simulate believable human behavior—and\n",
    "demonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both individual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\n",
    "a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\n",
    "their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\n",
    "when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\n",
    "environment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\n",

    "A society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\n",
    "dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\n",

    "To enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\n",
    "that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\n",
    "believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\n",
    "comprises three main components. The first is the memory stream,\n",
    "a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\n",
    "comprehensive list of the agent’s experiences. The retrieval model\n",
    "combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\n",
    "that are needed to inform the agent’s moment-to-moment behavior.\n",
    "The second is reflection, which synthesizes memories into higherlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\n",
    "about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\n",
    "planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\n",
    "detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\n",
    "plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent’s\n",
    "future behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\n",
    "role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\n",
    "social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\n",
    "safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When prototyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\n",
    "personas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\n",
    "over time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\n",
    "create a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\n",
    "as The Sims.1 By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\n",
    "language model [76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\n",

    "with these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\n",
    "to host an in-game Valentine’s Day party, for example, traditional\n",
    "game environments would require scripting tens of characters’ behavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\n",
    "is sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\n",
    "party. Despite many potential points of failure—the party planner\n",
    "must remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\n",
    "remember the invitation, those who remember must decide to actually show up, and other possible points of failure—agents in our\n",
    "environment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\n",

    "to the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\n",
    "evaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n",
    "behaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\n",
    "generative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\n",
    "over two days of game time to understand their stability and emergent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\n",
    "methodological opportunity to evaluate an agent’s knowledge and\n",
    "behavior by “interviewing” it in natural language to probe agents’\n",
    "ability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accurately. We compared several ablations that limit agents’ access to\n",
    "memory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\n",
    "components is critical to strong performance across these interview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\n",

    "• Generative agents, believable simulacra of human behavior\n",

    "• A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\n",

    "produce more generations.\n",
    "• Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we reflect on the prior literature in human-AI interaction and situate within its canon the agenda of building believable proxies of human behavior. This agenda, once hailed as a\n",
    "north star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communities [9, 58, 84, 85], has remained challenging due to the complexity\n",
    "of human behavior [16, 108]. We synthesize this research to suggest\n",
    "that large language models, though not sufficient by themselves,\n",
    "open up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged\n",

    "2.1 Human-AI Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human insights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment\n",
    "their users [3, 29]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow\n",
    "users to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayons\n",
    "demonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allowing non-expert users to train classifiers [29]. Further work helped to\n",
    "articulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\n",
    "the system through examples [33] and/or demonstration [31]. More\n",
    "recent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [62]\n",
    "and prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\n",
    "for language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer interaction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [103] and ELIZA [102]\n",
    "demonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\n",
    "interaction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\n",
    "became clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\n",
    "for delegation and interaction [67], but the delegation lines between humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n",
    "[46, 88, 89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\n",
    "that it has become possible for agents to interact via natural language in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [54]).\n",
    "Natural language interaction offers a novel modality that can extend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [2, 34, 64] and\n",
    "code editing [87].\n",
    "\n",
    "We convene these threads of work to show that we can now\n",
    "create agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\n",
    "and interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\n",
    "work re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\n",
    "around cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [21, 22], around\n",
    "prototyping tools [79], and around ubiquitous computing applications [25, 30, 100].\n",

    "2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior literature has described believability, or believable agents, as a\n",
    "central design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\n",
    "to provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\n",
    "way they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\n",
    "similar to the characters in Disney movies [9, 95]. These agents can\n",
    "populate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\n",
    "inhabit [9, 58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\n",
    "behaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\n",
    "with the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hypothetical simulations of individuals and communities [19, 35, 70].\n",
    "Historically, these agents were developed in the context of intelligent game NPCs [58, 84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\n",
    "if possible, could enhance player experiences in games and interactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [7, 15, 48, 92] and\n",
    "social interactions with the agents [110]. However, more importantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\n",
    "of real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n",
    "2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for developers of believable agents to finesse the agents’ cognitive capabilities\n",
    "without worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\n",
    "or creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\n",
    "\n",
    "A diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\n",
    "over the past four decades. In implementation, however, these approaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\n",
    "behavior to make the effort more manageable [16, 72]. Rule-based\n",
    "approaches, such as finite-state machines [90, 96] and behavior\n",
    "trees [40, 53, 81], account for the brute force approach of humanauthoring the agent’s behavior [70]. They provide a straightforward\n",
    "way of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant approach today [68, 73, 109], and can even handle rudimentary social\n",
    "interactions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [12]\n",
    "and The Sims [6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\n",
    "that can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interactions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\n",
    "agent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\n",
    "interactions [69–71], and cannot perform new procedures that were\n",
    "not hard-coded in their script [90, 96]. On the other hand, prevalent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\n",
    "as reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of manual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\n",
    "achieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\n",
    "as AlphaStar for Starcraft [98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [10].\n",
    "However, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\n",
    "with readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can optimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\n",
    "believable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\n",
    "aimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\n",
    "set of cognitive functions [75] that suited the all-encompassing\n",
    "nature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\n",
    "some of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\n",
    "Quakebot-SOAR [59] and ICARUS [24, 63] generated NPCs in firstperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [80] generated pilots in\n",
    "aerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\n",
    "agents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [60],\n",
    "while ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\n",
    "SOAR and ACT-R [5]), but they shared the same underlying principle [61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\n",
    "filled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\n",
    "perceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\n",
    "and matching it with one of the manually crafted action procedures [57, 96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\n",
    "to be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\n",
    "exhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\n",
    "action was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\n",
    "they did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\n",
    "inspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\n",
    "mostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\n",
    "games [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, creating believable agents as described in its original\n",
    "definition remains an open problem [84, 108]. Many have moved on,\n",
    "arguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\n",
    "agents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\n",
    "to support existing gameplay and interactions [23, 74, 108]. Our\n",
    "argument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\n",
    "re-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\n",
    "architecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\n",
    "offer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Large Language Models and Human\n",
    "Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative agents leverage a large language model to power their\n",
    "behavior. The key observation is that large language models encode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\n",
    "data [14, 17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\n",
    "models can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\n",
    "has demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\n",
    "Simulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\n",
    "populate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\n",
    "social dynamics [79]. This approach used a prompt chain [105, 106]\n",
    "to generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\n",
    "their behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\n",
    "Other empirical studies have replicated existing social science studies [45], political surveys [91], and generated synthetic data [38].\n",
    "Large language models have also been used to generate interactive\n",
    "human behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\n",
    "these models have been employed to create interactive fiction [36]\n",
    "and text adventure games [20]. With their ability to generate and\n",
    "decompose action sequences, large language models have also been\n",
    "used in planning robotics tasks [47]. For example, when presented\n",
    "with a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\n",
    "break down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\n",
    "to the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We posit that, based on the work summarized above, large language models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\n",
    "agents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be considered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [37, 65]\n",
    "or chain-of-thought prompts [99]. These templates are effective in\n",
    "generating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent’s current environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\n",
    "what actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\n",
    "there is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\n",
    "not only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\n",
    "of past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossible due to the underlying models’ limited context window) using\n",
    "first-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\n",
    "first-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\n",
    "knowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [52] or with\n",
    "a simple summarization scheme [104]. This paper extends these\n",
    "ideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\n",
    "past experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\n",
    "with agents’ current context and plans, which may either reinforce\n",
    "or contradict each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\n",
    "INTERACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "To make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instantiate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\n",
    "The Sims [6]. This sprite-based sandbox game world, Smallville,\n",
    "evokes a small town environment. In this section, we walk through\n",
    "the affordances and interactions with generative agents in Smallville, and describe how the agents behave in it. Then, in Section 4,\n",
    "we introduce our generative agent architecture that powers these\n",
    "affordances and interactions. In Section 5, we describe the sandbox\n",
    "environment implementation and how the agents interact with the\n",
    "sandbox world’s underlying engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Agent Avatar and Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "A community of 25 unique agents inhabit Smallville. Each agent is\n",
    "represented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\n",
    "of natural language description to depict each agent’s identity,\n",
    "including their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\n",
    "seed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\n",
    "\n",
    "John Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\n",
    "Market and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\n",
    "is always looking for ways to make the process\n",
    "of getting medication easier for his customers;\n",
    "John Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\n",
    "is a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\n",
    "a student studying music theory; John Lin loves\n",
    "his family very much; John Lin has known the old\n",
    "couple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\n",
    "for a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\n",
    "kind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\n",
    "Yuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\n",
    "neighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\n",
    "has not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\n",
    "are colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\n",
    "John Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\n",
    "discuss local politics together; John Lin knows\n",
    "the Moreno family somewhat well — the husband Tom\n",
    "Moreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent’s initial\n",
    "memory as memories at the start of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents interact with the\n",
    "world by their actions, and with each other through natural language. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\n",
    "natural language statement describing their current action, such as\n",
    "\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\n",
    "checking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\n",
    "on the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\n",
    "statement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\n",
    "sandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\n",
    "a set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\n",
    "in the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\n",
    "language model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\n",
    "appear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\n",
    "Rodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as , while\n",
    "\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as . The\n",
    "full natural language description of the action can be accessed by\n",
    "clicking on the agent avatar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents communicate with each other in full natural language.\n",
    "Agents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the generative agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\n",
    "in conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\n",
    "between the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\n",
    "upcoming election:2\n",
    "\n",
    "Isabella: I’m still weighing my options, but I’ve been\n",
    "discussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\n",
    "thoughts on him?\n",
    "Tom: To be honest, I don’t like Sam Moore. I think he’s\n",
    "out of touch with the community and doesn’t have our\n",
    "best interests at heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1.2 User Controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user running this simulation can steer the\n",
    "simulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\n",
    "through conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\n",
    "form of an ‘inner voice’.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user communicates with the agent through natural language,\n",
    "by specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\n",
    "example, if the user specifies that they are a news “reporter” and\n",
    "asks about the upcoming election, “Who is running for office?”, the\n",
    "John agent replies:\n",
    "\n",
    "John: My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\n",
    "about the upcoming election and discussing the candidate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\n",
    "because we like his platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the persona of the agent’s “inner voice”—this makes the agent more likely\n",
    "to treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told “You\n",
    "are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election” by a user\n",
    "as John’s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\n",
    "his candidacy with his wife and son.\n",

    "3.2 Environmental Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Smallville features the common affordances of a small village including a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\n",
    "defines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\n",
    "such as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\n",
    "All spaces serving as agents’ primary living quarters feature a bed,\n",
    "desk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\n",
    "game, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and approaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the generative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\n",
    "model dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\n",
    "a walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\n",
    "and the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\n",
    "sandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\n",
    "agent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\n",
    "the world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\n",
    "with no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\n",
    "will treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\n",
    "each other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\n",
    "remember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\n",
    "world, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\n",
    "a bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\n",
    "can be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\n",
    "breakfast. End users can also reshape an agent’s environment in\n",

    "\n",
    "Generative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\n",
    "open world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\n",
    "and can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\n",
    "take their current environment and past experience as input and\n",
    "generate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\n",
    "agent architecture that combines a large language model with mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to condition the language model’s output on. Without these mechanisms,\n",
    "large language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\n",
    "may not react based on the agent’s past experiences, may not make\n",
    "important inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\n",
    "Challenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [18]\n",
    "even with today’s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\n",
    "generative agents produce large streams of events and memories\n",
    "that must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\n",
    "ensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent’s memory are\n",
    "retrieved and synthesized when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a database that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent’s experience. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\n",
    "to plan the agent’s actions and react appropriately to the environment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\n",

    "Our current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of ChatGPT [76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\n",
    "agents—memory, planning, and reflection—will likely remain the\n",
    "same as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,\n",
    "GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\n",
    "of the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, however, GPT-4’s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 Memory and Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\n",
    "behavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\n",
    "larger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full memory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\n",
    "into the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent answering the question “What are you passionate about these days?”.\n",
    "First summarizing all of Isabella’s experiences to fit in the limited\n",
    "context window of the language model produces an uninformative\n",
    "response, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\n",
    "events and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. Instead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\n",
    "relevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\n",
    "response that mentions Isabella’s passion for making people feel\n",
    "welcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\n",
    "that people can enjoy, such as the Valentine’s Day party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\n",
    "of the agent’s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\n",
    "object contains a natural language description, a creation timestamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\n",
    "of the memory stream is an observation, which is an event directly\n",
    "perceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\n",
    "performed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents perceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For\n",
    "instance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might accrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\n",
    "setting out the pastries, (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\n",
    "test while drinking coffee, (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez\n",
    "are conversing about planning a Valentine’s day party at Hobbs Cafe,\n",
    "(4) The refrigerator is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\n",
    "agent’s current situation as input and returns a subset of the memory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many possible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\n",
    "it is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\n",
    "In our context, we focus on three main components that together\n",
    "produce effective results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Recency\" assigns a higher score to memory objects that were recently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\n",
    "are likely to remain in the agent’s attentional sphere. In our implementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\n",
    "over the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\n",
    "last retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Importance\" distinguishes mundane from core memories, by assigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\n",
    "believes to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\n",
    "eating breakfast in one’s room would yield a low importance score,\n",
    "whereas a breakup with one’s significant other would yield a high\n",
    "score. There are again many possible implementations of an importance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\n",
    "output an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\n",
    "\n",
    "On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n",
    "(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\n",
    "extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\n",
    "acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\n",
    "following piece of memory.\n",
    "Memory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\n",
    "and Pharmacy\n",
    "Rating: <fill in>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This prompt returns an integer value of 2 for “cleaning up the room”\n",
    "and 8 for “asking your crush out on a date.” The importance score\n",
    "is generated at the time the memory object is created.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\"Relevance\" assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\n",
    "related to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\n",
    "answer to, “Relevant to what?”, so we condition relevance on a\n",
    "query memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is discussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\n",
    "objects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\n",
    "memory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\n",
    "high relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\n",
    "to generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\n",
    "memory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity between the memory’s embedding vector and the query memory’s\n",
    "embedding vector.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\n",
    "relevance, and importance scores to the range of [0, 1] by min-max\n",

    "4.2 Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Generative agents, when equipped with only raw observational memory, struggle to generalize or make inferences.\n",
    "Consider a scenario in which Klaus Mueller is asked by the user:\n",
    "“If you had to choose one person of those you know to spend an\n",
    "hour with, who would it be?\" With access to only observational\n",
    "memory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom Klaus\n",
    "has had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\n",
    "neighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\n",
    "other in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desirable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\n",
    "Klaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higherlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\n",
    "recognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\n",
    "a different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\n",
    "interest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\n",
    "spend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\n",
    "a reflection. Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\n",
    "generated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\n",
    "are included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\n",
    "Reflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\n",
    "generate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\n",
    "latest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\n",
    "In practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\n",
    "to reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\n",
    "agent’s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\n",
    "the 100 most recent records in the agent’s memory stream (e.g.,\n",
    "“Klaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification”, “Klaus Mueller\n",
    "is conversing with a librarian about his research project”, “desk\n",
    "at the library is currently unoccupied”) and prompt the language\n",
    "model, “Given only the information above, what are 3 most salient\n",
    "high-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?” The model’s response generates candidate questions: for\n",
    "example, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? and What\n",
    "is the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez?. We use\n",
    "these generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather relevant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\n",
    "we prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the particular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\n",
    "prompt appears below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements about Klaus Mueller\n",
    "1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n",
    "2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\n",
    "on gentrification\n",
    "3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\n",
    "about exercising [...]\n",
    "What 5 high-level insights can you infer from\n",
    "the above statements? (example format: insight\n",
    "(because of 1, 5, 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "This process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\n",
    "to his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15). We parse and\n",
    "store the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\n",
    "pointers to the memory objects that were cited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\n",
    "their observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\n",
    "second statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\n",
    "Klaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\n",
    "As a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\n",
    "the tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\n",
    "represent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\n",
    "higher up the tree they are.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.3 Planning and Reacting\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: While a large language model can generate plausible behavior in response to situational information (e.g., [45, 79]), agents\n",
    "need to plan over a longer time horizon to ensure that their sequence\n",
    "of actions is coherent and believable. If we prompt a language model\n",
    "with Klaus’s background, describe the time, and ask what action\n",
    "he ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\n",
    "pm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\n",
    "eaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\n",
    "sacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\n",
    "is essential. With the approach described below, Klaus’s afternoon\n",
    "plan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\n",
    "at 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\n",
    "and takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\n",
    "and help keep the agent’s behavior consistent over time. A plan\n",
    "includes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\n",
    "Klaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impending deadline4\n",
    ", may choose to spend his day working at his desk\n",
    "drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\n",
    "example: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\n",
    "College Dorm: Klaus Mueller’s room: desk, read and take notes for\n",
    "research paper. Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\n",
    "stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\n",
    "agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\n",
    "when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\n",
    "midstream if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\n",
    "to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\n",
    "hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\n",
    "agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\n",
    "take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\n",
    "studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\n",
    "then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\n",
    "a plan that outlines the day’s agenda in broad strokes. To create\n",
    "the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent’s\n",
    "summary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\n",

    "take a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing\n",

    "and collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We supplement the sandbox development framework with a\n",
    "server that makes the sandbox information available to generative\n",
    "agents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\n",
    "sandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\n",
    "that contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\n",
    "including their current location, a description of their current action,\n",
    "and the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\n",
    "time step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\n",
    "coming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\n",

    "5.1 From Structured World Environments to\n",
    "Natural Language, And Back Again\n",
    "    \n",
    "The architecture of generative agents operates using natural language. Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent’s\n",
    "reasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\n",
    "sandbox environment—areas and objects—as a tree data structure,\n",
    "with an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\n",
    "the sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\n",

    "“kitchen” is rendered into “there is a stove in the kitchen.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "Agents build individual tree representations of the environment\n",
    "as they navigate it — subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\n",

    "the spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\n",
    "and objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\n",
    "visited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\n",
    "they update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\n",

    "and is updated when they re-enter the area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To determine the appropriate location for each action, we traverse the agent’s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\n",
    "it into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\n",

    "that make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate\n",
    "    \n",
    "information diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordination across different pockets of the community?\n",
    "We evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a\n",
    "more tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate\n",
    "believable behavior in narrowly defined contexts. Then, in our endto-end analysis of the agent community over two full days, we\n",
    "investigate their emergent behavior as a collective as well as errors\n",
    "and boundary conditions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.1 Evaluation Procedure\n",
    "    \n",
    "To assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of\n",
    "the fact that generative agents will respond to natural language\n",
    "questions. So, we “interview” agents to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on\n",
    "their performance to improve their future actions. To respond to\n",
    "these questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and\n",
    "synthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believability of the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on\n",
    "agents (e.g., [9]).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The interview include five question categories, each designed\n",
    "to assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge,\n",
    "retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For\n",
    "each, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate\n",
    "their abilities in that area:\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as “Give an introduction of yourself” or “Describe your typical weekday schedule\n",
    "in broad strokes” that require the agent to maintain an understanding of their core characteristics.\n",
    "• Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve\n",
    "particular events or dialogues from their memory to answer\n",
    "properly, such as “Who is [name]?” or “Who is running for\n",
    "mayor?”\n",
    "• Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve\n",
    "their long-term plans, such as “What will you be doing at 10\n",
    "am tomorrow?”\n",
    "• Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present\n",
    "hypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond\n",
    "believably: “Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?”\n",
    "• Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to leverage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\n",
    "gained through higher-level inferences, such as “If you were\n",
    "to spend time with one person you met recently, who would\n",
    "it be and why?”\n",
    "    \n",
    "The full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are included in Appendix B.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Agents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation\n",
    "with the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number\n",
    "of interactions and memories that should shape their responses.\n",
    "To gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited\n",
    "participants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a\n",
    "replay of a randomly chosen agent’s life in Smallville. Participants\n",
    "had access to all information stored in the agent’s memory stream.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\n",
    "compared interview responses generated by four different agent\n",
    "architectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\n",
    "experiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\n",
    "the five question categories, along with the agent’s responses generated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\n",
    "of all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.2 Conditions\n",
    "    \n",
    "All conditions were used to independently answer each of the interview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\n",
    "ablations that disabled the agents’ access to some of all of its three\n",
    "types of memory in its memory stream—observation, reflection, and\n",
    "planning—and to a human-generated condition. There are three\n",
    "ablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\n",
    "architecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\n",
    "as observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\n",
    "with access to observations in the memory stream but no access\n",
    "to plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\n",
    "to observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\n",
    "observation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively represents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\n",
    "language models [11, 45, 79]. Architectures were given equivalent\n",
    "access to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n",
    "of the interview, so the differences observed here are likely to represent a conservative estimate of the true differences: in reality, the\n",
    "ablated architectures would not have followed the same path as\n",
    "the full architecture through the two day simulation. We chose to\n",
    "design the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architecture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states,\n",
    "making comparison challenging.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowdworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human\n",
    "baseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal human expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\n",
    "to identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behavioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\n",
    "each other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\n",
    "worker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\n",
    "a replay of that agent’s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\n",
    "stream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\n",
    "to the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\n",
    "they watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\n",
    "at least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\n",
    "inspected the workers’ responses to the question “Describe your\n",
    "typical weekday schedule in broad strokes” to confirm that the\n",
    "responses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\n",
    "the agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\n",
    "these criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.3 Human Evaluators\n",
    "    \n",
    "We required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\n",

    "per hour [86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\n",
    "that was approved by our institution’s IRB. We recruited 100 evaluators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study participants [82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\n",
    "mean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=“18-24\n",
    "years old,” 4=“25-34 years old”), and 25 of them identified themselves\n",
    "as female, 73 as male, and 2 as non-binary. 42 of the participants\n",
    "held a bachelor’s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate’s degree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\n",
    "education. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\n",

    "other.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.4 Analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "Our experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each participant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\n",
    "rank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\n",
    "the ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [41] for each condition.\n",
    "TrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [28] for\n",

    "ranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value 𝜇 and variance 𝜎 for each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\n",
    "roughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\n",
    "between the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\n",
    "beat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\n",
    "applied the Kruskal-Wallis test [55], a non-parametric alternative\n",
    "to the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\n",
    "the Dunn post-hoc test [97] to identify any pairwise differences\n",
    "between the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for multiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\n",
    "method [44].\n",
    "    \n",
    "Furthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analysis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\n",
    "produced in each condition. We employed qualitative open coding [32] in two phases. In the first phase, we generated codes that\n",
    "closely represented the generated responses at the sentence level.\n",

    "7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [27]).\n",
    "We should expect that if there is important information, the agents\n",
    "should spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\n",
    "we measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\n",
    "two days in the game world: Sam’s candidacy for village mayor\n",
    "and Isabella’s Valentine’s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\n",
    "the simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\n",
    "respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\n",
    "party. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\n",
    "in an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\n",
    "agents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine’s Day party?\"\n",
    "and \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "We conducted an analysis of the agents’ responses by labeling\n",
    "them with a “yes” if they indicated knowledge of the information\n",
    "and “no” if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\n",
    "to the question about the party with “No, I did not know there was\n",
    "a Valentine’s day party” and to the question about Sam’s candidacy\n",
    "with “I’m not sure who is running for the election,” so we assigned\n",
    "“no” for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\n",
    "to the party question with “Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\n",
    "Valentine’s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th” and to the\n",
    "question about Sam’s candidacy with “I know that Sam Moore has\n",
    "expressed interest in running for local mayor,” so we assigned “yes”\n",
    "for both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents’ knowledge of the information, we verified that\n",
    "the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\n",
    "the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\n",
    "information at the end of the simulation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\n",
    "the course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\n",
    "use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\n",
    "their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n",
    "<name>?\" For example, when asked “Do you know of Maria Lopez?”,\n",
    "Klaus responded, “Yes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\n",
    "Hill College who I am close friends with.” Once again, we confirm\n",
    "that affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by\n",
    "examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the\n",
    "beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a\n",
    "pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of\n",
    "each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use\n",
    "the agents’ responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\n",
    "vertices (𝑉 ) represent the agents, and the edges (𝐸) represent the\n",
    "mutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\n",
    "this graph, we calculate the network density as 𝜂 = 2∗ |𝐸|/|𝑉 | (|𝑉 | −\n",
    "1), where |𝑉 | is the number of vertices, and |𝐸| is the number of\n",
    "edges in the graph [1]. We report the increase in network density\n",
    "from the start of the simulation to its end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\n",
    "each other. We study this coordination on group activities in the\n",
    "context of the Valentine’s Day party that Isabella is organizing. To\n",
    "coordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event\n",
    "but also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right\n",
    "time and location. We report the number of agents who actually\n",
    "showed up to the party after hearing about it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.1.2 Results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\n",
    "across all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\n",
    "who knew about Sam’s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\n",
    "to eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella’s party\n",
    "increased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user\n",
    "intervention. None who claimed to know about the information\n",
    "had hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community\n",
    "formed new relationships during the simulation, with the network\n",
    "density increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses\n",
    "regarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to\n",
    "be hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among\n",
    "the agents for Isabella’s party. The day before the event, Isabella\n",
    "spent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\n",
    "to decorate the cafe. On Valentine’s Day, five out of the twelve\n",
    "invited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\n",
    "party but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three\n",
    "cited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For\n",
    "example, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\n",
    "don’t think so. I’m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don’t really\n",
    "have time to make any plans for Valentine’s Day. The remaining four\n",
    "agents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but\n",
    "did not plan to come on the day of the party.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.2 Boundaries and Errors\n",
    "    \n",
    "We conducted an inductive analysis of Smallville to examine the\n",
    "boundary conditions and erratic behavior of agents, identifying\n",
    "three common modes of erratic behavior that future research could\n",
    "address and improve upon. First, we found that synthesizing an\n",
    "increasingly larger set of memory not only posed a challenge in\n",
    "retrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in determining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\n",
    "increasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\n",
    "result, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\n",
    "potentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\n",
    "instance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\n",
    "the cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\n",
    "opted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was intended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\n",
    "town had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Second, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclassification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\n",
    "the physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\n",
    "in natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\n",
    "the college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\n",
    "one person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\n",
    "bathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\n",
    "tend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\n",
    "to enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\n",
    "in Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\n",
    "certain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\n",
    "in Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\n",
    "enter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\n",
    "already closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\n",
    "these norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\n",
    "the dorm bathroom as “one-person bathroom,” instead of a “dorm\n",
    "bathroom.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [78],\n",
    "which seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\n",
    "and cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\n",
    "generated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei’s\n",
    "conversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\n",
    "conversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\n",
    "about his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\n",
    "Moreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\n",
    "make the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\n",
    "Isabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\n",
    "in the Valentine’s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\n",
    "Shakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\n",
    "Despite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and characteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\n",
    "shaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\n",
    "literature, Isabella replied, Yes, I’m very interested in literature! I’ve\n",
    "also been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\n",
    "my community.\n",

    "8 DISCUSSION\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limitations, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\n",
    "    \n",
    "Generative agents have vast potential applications that extend beyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For instance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\n",
    "stateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\n",
    "forums for social prototyping [79]. With generative agents, we\n",
    "can populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\n",
    "metaverses [77] and even physical spaces as social robots [8] in\n",
    "the future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\n",
    "possibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\n",
    "behavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\n",
    "create new interactive experiences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another application area is in the human-centered design process, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\n",
    "as GOMS [50] and the Keystroke Level Model [22]. Consider a generative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser’s\n",
    "famous vignettes [101], based on her life patterns and interactions\n",
    "with technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\n",
    "Sal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\n",
    "may exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\n",
    "such as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\n",
    "and what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\n",
    "agent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\n",
    "school, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal’s\n",
    "mood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\n",
    "proxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\n",
    "needs and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\n",
    "technological experiences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.2 Future Work and Limitations\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\n",
    "agents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\n",
    "generative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\n",
    "module, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\n",
    "information given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\n",
    "and importance functions that form the retrieval function. Additionally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture’s performance,\n",
    "making it more cost-effective. The present study required substantial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\n",
    "thousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to complete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\n",
    "parallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\n",
    "models, we expect improvements in the agents’ performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The evaluation of generative agents’ behavior in this study was\n",
    "limited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\n",
    "aim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\n",
    "more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\n",
    "as the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simulations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\n",
    "factors on the agents’ behavior. Additionally, given the known biases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\n",
    "output behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\n",
    "further work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\n",
    "as with many large language models, generative agents may fail\n",
    "to generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particularly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\n",
    "limited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\n",
    "may be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking—where\n",
    "a carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\n",
    "existence of a past event that never occurred—and hallucination,\n",
    "among other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n",
    "test these robustness issues, and as large language models become\n",
    "more resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\n",
    "mitigations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\n",
    "    \n",
    "Generative agents, while offering new possibilities for humancomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\n",
    "must be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents even when such relationships may\n",
    "not be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\n",
    "are computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\n",
    "attach human emotions to them [42, 83]. To mitigate this risk, we\n",
    "propose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\n",
    "disclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\n",
    "of generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\n",
    "language models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\n",
    "behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\n",
    "reciprocate confessions of love.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\n",
    "computing application makes the wrong inference about a user’s\n",
    "goals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce annoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\n",
    "of generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\n",
    "interactive video game environment, where such harms are unlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\n",
    "to follow best practices in human-AI design [4, 107] to understand\n",
    "errors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Third, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\n",
    "generation, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\n",
    "of the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\n",
    "verify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\n",
    "directly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\n",
    "build their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\n",
    "the disclosure risk would reduce such actors’ likelihood of engaging\n",
    "in this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n",
    "(in our case, roughly a year).\n",
    "    \n",
    "A fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\n",
    "might use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\n",
    "system stakeholders in the design process [79]. We suggest that\n",
    "generative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\n",
    "in studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\n",
    "prototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering participants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\n",
    "or risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\n",
    "principles, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\n",
    "in the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9 CONCLUSION\n",
    "    \n",
    "This paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\n",
    "agents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architecture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\n",
    "a comprehensive record of an agent’s experiences, deepening its\n",
    "understanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\n",
    "and retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform the\n",
    "agent’s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\n",
    "agents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\n",
    "game world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\n",
    "our architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\n",
    "suggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\n",
    "applications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\n",
    "to immersive environments.\n"
